### What should I do if the recharge has not arrived?

Blockchain asset transfer is divided into three steps : **proposal** - **block confirmation** - **entry** .
1. Propose: Successful transfer means that the platform or wallet withdrawing money has performed the transfer operation;
2. Block confirmation: Complete the confirmation of the corresponding network block. If the block chain is congested, delayed, etc., your coins will not be fully confirmed and will be delayed. Please wait patiently. Generally, it takes about 10-30 minutes to confirm the digital currency block.
3. Deposit: Once fully confirmed, the platform will complete the deposit as soon as possible. If the block is not fully confirmed, please wait patiently. Only after the confirmation is completed, the platform can credit for you. If the block has been fully confirmed, but the ICNCDE account has not been received, please contact online customer service or submit a work order for processing.

### What should I do if the withdrawal is not received?

Withdrawal and transfer are divided into three stages : **ICNCDE exchange payment** - **block confirmation** - **counterparty posting** .
1. Payment: We will generate TXID within 30-60 minutes, which means that the transfer processing of our platform has been completed and the currency has been transferred to the blockchain.
2. Block confirmation: Please click on the "check" link at the end of TXID and open the corresponding blockchain browser to check the number of confirmations for the withdrawal.
3. The other party submits the account: If the blockchain shows that it is confirming or not confirming, please wait patiently for the confirmation of the blockchain. If the blockchain shows that the confirmation is complete, if you still cannot receive the currency, since the ICNCDE exchange has completed the currency transfer, we can no longer provide assistance. Please contact the corresponding currency receiving address platform to post your account.
