### BTC (Bitcoin)
##### 1. What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin (BTC for short) is currently the most widely used digital currency. It was born on January 3, 2009. It is a digital encrypted currency for peer-to-peer (P2P) transmission, with a total of 21 million. The Bitcoin network releases a certain amount of coins every 10 minutes, which is expected to reach its limit in 2140. Bitcoin is called "digital gold" by investors. Bitcoin is generated through a large number of calculations based on a specific algorithm. It does not rely on specific currency institutions to issue. It uses a distributed database composed of many nodes in the entire P2P network to confirm and record all transaction behaviors, and uses cryptographic design to ensure currency circulation. The security of the link can ensure that the value of the currency cannot be manipulated through the large-scale production of Bitcoin. The design based on cryptography allows Bitcoin to be transferred, paid and cashed only by the real owner. It also ensures the anonymity of currency ownership and circulation transactions.

Bitcoin is favored by technology enthusiasts due to its decentralization, global circulation, low transaction costs, and anonymous circulation. Recently, traditional financial institutions such as Wall Street and central banks of many countries have begun to study Bitcoin blockchain technology. The Japanese government has officially recognized Bitcoin as a legal payment method, and more and more Japanese merchants have accepted Bitcoin payments.

##### 2. What are the advantages of Bitcoin?

Freedom of payment-any amount of funds can be paid and received instantly anytime and anywhere. No bank holidays, no borders, and no restrictions imposed. Bitcoin allows its users to fully control their funds.

Very low fees-currently there are no fees or very small fees for the processing of Bitcoin payments. Users can include the handling fee in the transaction to get processing priority, and receive the transaction confirmation from the network faster. In addition, there are merchant processors that assist merchants in processing transactions, converting bitcoins into legal tender every day and depositing funds directly into merchants’ bank accounts. Because these services are based on Bitcoin, they can provide fees that are much lower than PayPal or credit card networks.

Reduce risk for merchants-Bitcoin transactions are secure, irrevocable, and do not contain sensitive or personal information of customers. This avoids losses to merchants due to fraud or fraudulent chargebacks, and there is no need to comply with PCI standards. Where credit cards are unusable or fraud rates are unacceptably high, merchants can easily expand into new markets. The end result is lower costs, a larger market, and fewer administrative costs.

Security and control-Bitcoin users are in full control of their transactions; merchants cannot forcefully charge fees that may occur in other payment methods that should not be or are not easily discovered. Paying with Bitcoin eliminates the need to bind personal information in the transaction, which provides great protection against identity theft. Bitcoin users can also protect their funds through backup and encryption.

Transparency and neutrality-All information about the Bitcoin funding supply itself is stored in the blockchain, and anyone can check and use it in real time. No individual or organization can control or manipulate the Bitcoin protocol because it is password protected. This makes Bitcoin Core believed to be completely neutral, transparent and predictable.

##### 3. What are the disadvantages of Bitcoin?

Acceptance-There are still many people who don't know Bitcoin. Every day, more companies accept Bitcoin because they want to benefit from it, but this list is still small. In order to benefit from network effects, more companies still need to support Bitcoin.

Volatility-the total value of bitcoins in circulation and the number of businesses using bitcoins are still very small compared to their possible size. Therefore, relatively small events, transactions or business activities can significantly affect its price. In theory, as the Bitcoin market and technology mature, this volatility will decrease. This world has never seen an emerging currency before, so it is really difficult (and exciting at the same time) to imagine how it will progress.

In development stage-Bitcoin software is still in beta version, and many unfinished features are in active development stage. New tools, features and services are being developed to make Bitcoin safer and more accessible to the general public. Some of these functions are not currently available to every user. Most of the Bitcoin business is new and does not yet provide insurance. In general, Bitcoin is still in the process of maturity.

### DASH (Dash)
1.	What is Dash?

Dash, the English name DASH, is an open source peer-to-peer (P2P) encrypted currency that can provide instant transaction, anonymous transaction and alternative currency functions.

The Dash network is protected by a proof-of-work mining (consensus mechanism used by Bitcoin) mechanism, and it uses the X11 algorithm based on 11 different hash functions. The master node is a proof-of-service layer. These nodes act as a transaction mixer and booster at the same time. In addition, it also serves as a voting mechanism for the Dash management system.

The block reward of Dash will be divided into two layers (miners and master nodes). Among them, the miners get 45% of the return, the master node receives 45%, and the remaining 10% is allocated to the decentralized Dash budget system. The generation time of each block is 2.5 minutes, and each block is given to the miners 3.6 Dash rewards. The details are as follows:

1.	background

Considering the anonymity of Bitcoin and the speed of transaction processing, Evan Duffield and his team started the research and development of DASH, and formally founded Dash in January 2014. So far, Dash has completed related improvements on the basis of Bitcoin, and has improved the anonymity of transactions by obfuscating transactions by the decentralized network server "master node". At the same time, based on the node, the transaction processing speed is improved, and thus a decentralized and well-anonymized Dash was born.

1.	Features

High anonymity: In Bitcoin transactions, all transaction data will be recorded in the data block chain, and the whereabouts of the Bitcoin can be seen, so that the receiving and sending parties can be queried. However, Dash uses the technology of anonymous sending and the decentralized network server "master node" to obfuscate transactions, so that transactions cannot be tracked and queried, thereby achieving high anonymity.

Instant delivery: Bitcoin network takes 10 minutes or even hours to confirm the transaction, and Dash can be sent instantly.

Self-management system: Through this system, Dash Network can allocate resources for R&D and marketing through proposals and voting, and any user can create and submit proposals on the network.

### EOS (EOS)
1. What is EOS?

EOS (Enterprise Operation System) is a brand new blockchain-based smart contract platform led by Block.one, which aims to provide underlying blockchain platform services for high-performance distributed applications. The goal of the EOS project is to achieve a blockchain architecture that supports distributed applications similar to an operating system. The architecture can provide accounts, identity authentication, databases, asynchronous communication, and program scheduling and parallel operations on tens of thousands of CPU/GPU clusters. EOS can eventually support the execution of millions of transactions per second, while ordinary users do not need to pay usage fees to execute smart contracts.

2. EOS function

EOS token is currently an Ethereum-based token issued by the EOS blockchain infrastructure. There are three main application scenarios: bandwidth and log storage (hard disk), calculation and calculation reserve (CPU), and state storage (RAM). After the EOS mainnet goes live, ERC20 token EOS will be converted into tokens on the main chain. It can be explained as:

(1) Recipient payment: The customer purchases specific products from the business, and the sales revenue of these products will be used to pay for the business cost, avoiding the customer to directly pay for the use of the blockchain, and will not restrict or prevent the company from determining its product Monetization strategy.

(2) Authorization capability: If a blockchain is developed based on the EOS software system, and its token is held by a token holder, he may not need to consume all or part of the available bandwidth immediately. Such tokens The holder can choose to give or lease the unconsumed bandwidth to others.

(3) Separate transaction costs from token value: If the application owner holds a corresponding number of tokens, then the application can continue to run in a fixed state and bandwidth usage. Developers and users will not be affected by price fluctuations in the token market and therefore will not depend on prices.

(4) Block reward: Every time a block is generated, EOS will reward the block producer with new tokens to pay for its operation and maintenance costs. The current EOS setting limits the upper limit of rewards for block producers. The current upper limit of rewards set by EOS to block producers is up to 5% per year, that is, the total annual increase in the new supply of tokens does not exceed 5%.

### ETC (Ethereum Classic)
1.	What is the etheric classic?

ETC (Ethereum Classic) is a forked currency that is hard-forked after 1,920,000 blocks, and its function is very similar to Ethereum. ETC upholds the concept of decentralization and supports the consensus mechanism guaranteed by the blockchain. ETC firmly believes that once the blockchain starts to operate, its development direction will not be controlled by any central team, but will be determined by the consensus of the people participating in the entire network and the consensus of the entire network's computing power.

The hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain in July 2016 aimed to transfer the funds of The DAO stolen by hackers to an account controlled by investors and to make old transaction records forgotten by history. Most Ethereum developers participated in this reversal, as did exchanges, startups, and other members of the ecosystem. A few days later, the project returned to normal. But not everyone wants to forget the old transaction records. So a small group of miners continued to use the original blockchain as a protest. They described the hard fork as an act of drawing funds for the abandoned project of The DAO. So Ethereum Classic (ETC) was born.

### ETH (Ethereum)
1. What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a next-generation cryptographic ledger that can support many advanced functions, including user issuance of currency, smart protocols, decentralized transactions and the establishment of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) or decentralized autonomous companies (DACs) ). Ethereum does not specifically support every single type of function as a feature. On the contrary, Ethereum includes a built-in Turing-complete scripting language that allows you to write the features you want to achieve through a mechanism called "contract" Code. A contract is like an automatic agent. Whenever a transaction is received, the contract will run a specific piece of code, which can modify the data storage within the contract or send the transaction. Advanced contracts can even modify their own code.

In layman's terms, Ethereum is an open source platform digital currency and blockchain platform. It provides developers with a platform for building and publishing applications on the blockchain. Ethereum can be used to program, decentralize, guarantee and trade anything, voting, domain names, financial exchanges, crowdfunding, company management, contracts and most agreements, intellectual property rights, and smart assets that benefit from hardware integration.

On February 28, 2017, a group of global companies representing the oil and gas industry, financial industry and software development companies officially launched the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), dedicated to developing Ethereum into an enterprise-level blockchain. These companies include British oil giant BP, JPMorgan Chase, software developers Microsoft, Accenture, Santander, BlockApps, BNY Mellon, CME Group, ConsenSys, Intel Microsoft and Nuco. Many companies or organizations develop projects based on the Ethereum blockchain and issue tokens. The United Nations World Food Program successfully used the Ethereum blockchain to provide relief to 10,000 refugees.

### FIL (Filecoin)
1. Project name

FIL (Filecoin)

2. Project positioning

Filecoin is a peer-to-peer network for storing files with a built-in economic incentive mechanism to ensure reliable storage of files over time. In Filecoin, users pay to store their files on storage miners. Storage miners are computers that are responsible for storing files and proving that they have stored files correctly over time. Anyone who wants to store their files or want to get paid for storing other users' files can join Filecoin. The available storage space and the price of that storage space are not controlled by any one company. Instead, Filecoin promotes an open market to store and retrieve files that anyone can participate in.

Filecoin includes blockchain and native cryptocurrency (FIL). Storage miners earn FIL units by storing files. Filecoin's blockchain records the transactions to send and receive FIL, as well as proofs from storage miners, proving that they stored the files correctly.

### LTC (Litecoin)
1. What is Litecoin?

Litecoin was born on November 9, 2011 and is called "digital silver". Litecoin has the same implementation principle as Bitcoin technically. It is the first network digital currency based on the Scrypt algorithm. Compared with Bitcoin, Litecoin has a faster transaction confirmation time, higher network transaction capacity and efficiency. Litecoin now has a complete industrial chain and sufficient liquidity to prove that it is a mature, safe and stable commercial financial system.

2. Data Block Chain

Compared with its competitor, Bitcoin, the Litecoin data block chain can handle a larger transaction volume. Since the output of data blocks is more frequent, the network can support more transactions, and there is no need to modify the software in the future. Therefore, merchants can obtain faster transaction confirmations and can still wait for more transaction confirmations when selling large-value commodities.

3. Wallet encryption

Wallet encryption can ensure the security of the private key in your wallet, so that you can view the transaction status and account balance, but you must enter the password before you can use Litecoin. This function can not only prevent the intrusion of viruses and Trojan horses, but also an effective check for legality before payment.

4. Mining rewards

"Miners" currently produce 25 Litecoins per data block. Every 4 years, the amount of Litecoin currency produced will be reduced by half (every 840,000 data blocks passed). Therefore, the total amount of money produced by the Litecoin network will be 4 times that of Bitcoin, or 84 million Litecoins.

The creation and transfer of Litecoin is based on an open source encryption protocol and is not subject to the management of any central authority. Litecoin aims to change Bitcoin. Compared with it, Litecoin has three significant differences:

(1) The Litecoin network can process a block every 2.5 minutes (instead of 10 minutes), so it can provide faster transaction confirmation.

(2) The expected output of the Litecoin network is 84 million, which is four times the amount of currency issued by the Bitcoin network.

(3) Litecoin uses the scrypt encryption algorithm first proposed by Colin Percival in its proof of work algorithm.

In April 2017, the Litecoin community voted to reach an agreement and decided to upgrade its blockchain through an isolated verification soft fork. In June of the same year, the Litecoin Lightning Network was officially launched.

### USDT (Tether)
1. What is USDT

USDT is a token Tether USD (hereinafter referred to as USDT) based on the stable value currency U.S. dollar (USD) launched by Tether. 1USDT = 1 U.S. dollar. Users can use USDT to exchange 1:1 with USD at any time. Tether strictly abides by the 1:1 reserve guarantee, that is, for every USDT token issued, its bank account will have 1 USD fund guarantee. Users can check funds on the Tether platform to ensure transparency. Users can wire US dollars through SWIFT to the bank account provided by Tether, or exchange USDT through the exchange. When redeeming USD, the reverse operation is sufficient. Users can also exchange bitcoins for USDT on the exchange.

USDT is a digital asset based on the Omni Layer protocol released on the Bitcoin blockchain. The biggest feature of USDT is that it is equivalent to the same amount of US dollars. USDT is designed as a copy of legal currency on the digital network, making it a good value-preserving token in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

2. Features

Intuitive: USDT and US dollars are equivalent, 1USDT=1 US dollar. Each currency = how many USDT, which is equivalent to its unit price in US dollars.

Stability: Because TEDA is backed by legal currency, users can still trade on the blockchain asset market without being affected by the price fluctuations of most blockchain assets.

Transparency: Tether, the issuing company of TEDA coins, claims that its legal currency storage accounts are regularly audited to ensure that every TEDA coin in circulation on the market is backed by a corresponding dollar. The status of the storage account is public and can be queried at any time. In addition, all TEDA coin transaction records will be published on the public chain.

Small transaction fees: There are no fees for transactions between Tether accounts or transactions between wallets with Tether coins. A transaction service fee is required to convert TEDA coins into legal tender.

### XMR (Currency)
1. Project name

Monero (XMR)

2. Project positioning

Monero uses encryption to block sending and receiving addresses and transaction amounts, which is different from other public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
By default, every Monero transaction will confuse the sending and receiving addresses and the transaction amount. Monero is replaceable. This means that Monero will always be accepted without the risk of censorship.

Monroe is not a company. It is developed by cryptography and distributed system experts from all over the world, who donate time or are funded by community donations. This means that Monroe cannot be closed by any country, nor is it restricted by any specific legal jurisdiction.

Three, currency overview and distribution

Total tokens: about 16 million XMR + mining

Circulation quantity: 100%

### XRP (Ripple)
1. What is Ripple (XRP)?

Ripple/XRP provides an unimpeded global payment network using blockchain technology. It is the world’s first open payment network. By joining Ripple’s growing global payment network, any currency can be transferred, including U.S. dollars, euros, renminbi, yen or bitcoin are simple and fast. Transaction confirmation is completed within a few seconds. Transaction costs are almost zero. There are no so-called cross-bank or cross-border payments. Ripple is an open source point-to-point payment network, which allows any institution or individual to easily, cheaply and securely transfer money to any institution or individual on the Internet, no matter where in the world. Ripple is a p2p software, there is no individual, company, or government control, anyone can create a ripple account.

Since May 2017, Ripple’s validator network has expanded by 140% to 55 participants, including WorldLink, Telindus-Proximus Group, Microsoft, MIT, CGI, Swedish ISP, Bahnhof, and data center and system integration Service provider AT TOKYO, etc. All these participants are now maintaining the integrity of the XRP ledger (previously known as the Ripple Consensus Ledger), and running software to help them reach an agreement on transaction settlement orders.

2. Features

Ripple is the only universal currency in the Ripple system. It is different from other currencies in the Ripple system. Other currencies such as CNY and USD cannot be withdrawn across gateways. In other words, the CNY issued by Gateway A can only be withdrawn on Gateway A. If you want to withdraw cash at Gateway B, you must use the pending order function of the ripple system to convert to the CNY of Gateway B before you can withdraw at Gateway B. Ripple has no restrictions in this respect, and it is universal in the ripple system.
