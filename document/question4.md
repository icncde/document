### How to prevent phishing attacks?

##### 1. What is fishing?
Phishing attacks are criminal fraud processes that pretend to be others to obtain sensitive personal information such as usernames, passwords, credentials, and ID cards. These communications all claim to (self) come from an official, operator, customer service, or network manager, in order to trick the victim into gaining credibility.

##### 2. Phishing transmission method
Clone a website that is exactly the same as ICNCDE **through a virus** -criminals, and then use some computer virus programs, junk software, etc. to send the fake website address to the customer's computer, or put it on the search website to trick the user Log in to steal user account passwords, transaction information or credentials, etc.

**Through mobile text messages** -criminals use mobile text messages to pretend to be ICNCDE to send fraudulent text messages to users, claiming that the user has won a lottery or the account has been stolen by others, etc., and requires users to log in to the website designated in the text message as soon as possible for authentication. This website is a fake website built by criminals and used to obtain user information. If a user logs in to the website and performs operations, the user's account, password and other information will be illegally learned.

**By establishing a fake website** --the criminals first set up a fake website, and then publish false activity information on social platforms such as QQ and WeChat. The activity often draws a large pie to the user. The account and password information will be learned by criminals when logging in to the fake website.

Send fraudulent emails illegally **by pretending to be an official email** address to induce users to log in to fake websites. These emails are mostly used for various reasons such as winning prizes and system upgrades. The recipient is required to click on the link address on the email to log in one. The interface is similar to the ICNCDE web. Once the user enters his/her own account password and other information in this designated login interface, the information will be stolen.

##### 3. Anti-phishing
1. Use a safer Chrome browser and upgrade to the latest version; Note: Chrome is a product of Google, and the security is generally recognized as high. Upgrading to the latest version is because there are many loopholes in the lower version.
2. Do not install browser plug-ins at will; Note: The browser plug-ins have high authority and there is a risk of account theft.
3. Do not open untrusted link addresses, do not enter ICNCDE account passwords and personal information on unknown websites to avoid being stolen by phishing websites or network Trojan horses; install anti-virus software and regularly anti-virus on computers and mobile phones; update on time System patch
4. Please do not send the official verification code to others; when you log in or perform transaction-related operations, please make sure whether the domain name belongs to ICNCDE. For unknown domain names, you can consult customer service.
