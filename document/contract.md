### Margin & Margin Call

<font color='red'> Margin is the funds you allocate from your account equity to create a position </font>

For example, a transaction with an investment amount of US$500

and a leverage of 5 times would have an exposure of US$2500.

The margin is 500 USD, which is equivalent to 20%.

##### Margin call

Since ICNCDE is an online trading platform, it is necessary to arrange a buffer zone to protect the safety of traders and the platform when the value of a particular asset changes suddenly. Therefore, ICNCDE requires that all users' accounts must reserve specific cash as a margin. Once a particular customer's account does not have enough net cash value to maintain the margin ratio, a margin call will be triggered. If the account reaches the margin of the margin call, all open positions will be forcibly closed, and the account will be frozen until the client deposits sufficient funds.

For example: if the balance is -50 USD and the present value of the open positions is 50 USD or less (including unrealized gains), then all positions will be forced to close to avoid negative equity in the account.


### CFD rules

##### 1. Introduction to the contract

CFDs are virtual contract products priced and settled in digital currencies launched by the ICNCDE exchange. The contract trading unit depends on the type of transaction and the type of valuation. The currently launched products cover stocks (US, UK, Australia) and commodities The four major markets (non-ferrous metals, energy, agricultural products), indices (North America, Europe, Australia, Asia-Pacific), and foreign exchange provide channels for investors to avoid risks, amplify returns, hedging, asset allocation, and arbitrage investment.

##### 2. Contract features

Product pricing: anchor the original market real-time price of the product, and the transaction time remains the same; 

Denominated currency: Use mainstream digital currencies in the market, such as BTC and USDT as the denominated currency, to enjoy the double-layer income of the data currency and the traditional market; 

Margin: The user purchases the contract Own funds payable, the higher the leverage, the less margin payable

##### 3. Profit and loss calculation

User closing profit and loss are calculated according to the direction of buying up and selling down:

Buying up: (closing price-opening price) × opening quantity × contract multiplier-opening handling fee-closing handling fee

Selling price: (opening price-closing price) × opening quantity × contract multiplier-opening handling fee-closing handling fee

Example: User A holds $2,000, and the price of BTC at this time is $10,000. A exchanged 0.2 BTC, bought 300 lots of AAPL (Apple) shares at $53.00, and closed all positions when the price rose to 55.

Buy Apple shares directly to buy: 2000÷53=37 shares
|  CFDs    |  Original Market   |
| --- | --- |
|   Gross profit: (55－53)×300×0.0001=0.06  |   Gross profit: (55－53 )×37=74  |
|  Net profit: 0.06－53×300×0.0001×0.05%－55×300×0.0001×0.05%=0.05838   |   Net profit: 74－10=64  |
|   Profit rate: 0.05838÷0.2×100%= 29.19%  |   Profit rate: 64÷2000×100%=3.2%  |



##### 4. transaction costs


When trading, the user's transaction fee is divided into three parts, the opening fee, the closing fee and the overnight fee, of which the overnight fee will be charged when the position is held overnight.

Opening handling fee = opening quantity × opening price × contract multiplier × opening fee rate;

Closing fee = closing quantity × closing price × contract multiplier × closing fee rate;

Overnight fee = (current interbank interest rate + current financing interest rate) × number of positions opened × contract multiplier × yesterday's closing price ÷ 360


##### 5. stop profit and stop loss

When opening a position, users can set profit and stop loss to prevent risks and lock in profits. There are three ways to stop profit and loss: price, amount, and percentage:

Price Take Profit (Stop Loss): Set a fixed price, after the market reaches the set price, the transaction order will be automatically closed;

Amount Take Profit (Stop Loss): After the profit (loss) reaches the set amount, the transaction order is automatically closed;

Percentage Take Profit (Stop Loss): the ratio of profit (loss) to margin. When the ratio is reached, the transaction order will be automatically closed;


##### 6. forced closing

If the leverage is too high and the market develops in the opposite direction to expectations, the transaction order may be liquidated. When users trade,

Each transaction will have a corresponding strong parity, and the paid margin is used as the basis for calculation of strong parity:

Buying strong parity = opening price-(margin-overnight fee-opening handling fee) ÷ (opening quantity × contract multiplier)

Selling strong parity = opening price + (margin-overnight fee-opening handling fee) ÷ (opening quantity × contract multiplier)


### Cost and profit and loss calculation

User closing profit and loss are calculated according to the direction of buying up and selling down:

Buying up: (closing price-opening price) × opening quantity × contract multiplier-opening handling fee-closing handling fee

Selling price: (opening price-closing price) × opening quantity × contract multiplier-opening handling fee-closing handling fee

Example: User A holds $2,000, and the price of BTC at this time is $10,000. A exchanged 0.2 BTC, bought 300 lots of AAPL (Apple) shares at $53.00, and closed all positions when the price rose to 55.
