### CFD trading mechanism

In CFDs, the trigger prices for users to open, close, take profit, and stop loss are all the latest prices, and the actual transaction price is the buying and selling price. For example: at this time, the latest price of the BTC/USD contract is 9852.5, the selling price is 9850, and the buying price is 9855. When the user shorts BTC/USD, the opening cost is 9,850, and when the user goes long BTC/USD, the opening cost is 9855. The trigger prices for position closing, stop profit and stop loss are subject to the latest price.

### What are the trading rules for CFDs?

1. The user judges the direction of long and short according to the trend of the product, and pays the corresponding margin to buy long and short positions.
2. The user chooses the appropriate price and quantity to trade. Only when the available funds in the account are greater than or equal to the amount of margin after the transaction is successful, the user can perform entrusted operations.
3. Users can adjust their positions at any time according to market conditions, lock in gains or stop losses by closing positions, or continue to open positions to chase gains.
4. All realized profits and losses will be reflected to the account balance simultaneously.

### In the CFD, the transaction is closed

Stock index futures, foreign exchange, commodities and other products have corresponding trading hours (equivalent to the opening time and closing time of stocks). During the product closing period, when the user clicks to trade, the system will prompt non-trading hours and no orders can be placed.
